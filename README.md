# term-project (VGG16 From Scratch)


For running the VGG16 model without transfer learning, multiple attempts have been committed to help optimize the results. Below is the test runs found within the outputs folder that are referenced in the report.

## with_history_march_21_100_epochs
This is training and testing for the VGG16 model for 2dense output (train-talc-2dense.py, train-talc2dense.slurm.out, VGG16_Scratch2Dense_history.npy) as well as the single output 52 class model (train-talc.py, train-talc.slurm.out, VGG16_Scratch52_history.npy).

The models callback before 100 epochs reached as per mentioned in report.
